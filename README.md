## What
Blonk is an unofficial Java client for [Blink](https://blinkforhome.com).
Documentation and research was done by @MattTW in [BlinkMonitorProtocol](https://github.com/MattTW/BlinkMonitorProtocol).

I'm mostly excited about this because of the [Lonk](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/lonk) meme:

So I'll be extra sad if I don't do more with this project. I promise I'll be back with something more than just being able to log in.
